## Requirements

Since we completed the project in django, you need to install django package in your environment to execute it successfully.

You can run the following command in a virtual environment to install all the needed packages.
```
cd project
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
```

## Usage

To activate the server, you can type
```
cd project
python manage.py runserver
```
After running the server, you can go [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to view the website.

## Testing

We also provide a custom account for testing
```
